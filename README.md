# Linear_Regression_Housing-Market

I undertook this project driven by a deep personal interest in the process of purchasing a home. This endeavor provided me with valuable insights and a comprehensive understanding of the housing market, which I found both fascinating and essential for making informed decisions in my own home-buying journey
